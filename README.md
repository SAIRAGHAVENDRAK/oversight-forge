## 🎨 Design System

The application uses a professional, corporate design aesthetic inspired by enterprise operations dashboards:

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deep navy/indigo for authority and trust
- **Accent**: Bright blue for interactive elements
- **Status Colors**:
  - Critical: Red (#DC2626)
  - High: Orange-red (#EF4444)
  - Medium: Amber (#F59E0B)
  - Low: Green (#10B981)
  - Info: Blue (#3B82F6)

### Key Design Features
- Dark sidebar navigation with clean hierarchy
- Card-based layouts for content organization
- Status-driven color coding for risk levels
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Smooth transitions and hover states

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm installed
- Basic understanding of React and TypeScript

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Demo Credentials
For the login page, use any email/password combination (authentication will be implemented with backend integration).

## 📊 Data Structure

### Core Types
- **Audit**: Audit engagement with metadata, team, and findings summary
- **Finding**: Individual audit finding with risk level, status, and ownership
- **User**: User profile with role and department
- **Alert**: System alerts and notifications
- **KPIMetric**: Dashboard metrics with trends

See `src/types/audit.ts` for complete type definitions.

## 🔌 Backend Integration (Planned)

The application is structured to easily integrate with a REST API backend:

### Planned API Endpoints
```
GET    /api/audits              # List all audits
POST   /api/audits              # Create new audit
GET    /api/audits/:id          # Get audit details
PUT    /api/audits/:id          # Update audit
DELETE /api/audits/:id          # Delete audit

GET    /api/findings            # List findings (with filters)
POST   /api/findings            # Create finding
GET    /api/findings/:id        # Get finding details
PUT    /api/findings/:id        # Update finding
DELETE /api/findings/:id        # Delete finding

GET    /api/analytics           # Get analytics data
GET    /api/users               # List users
GET    /api/alerts              # Get active alerts
```

### Suggested Backend Stack
- **FastAPI** (Python) for high-performance REST API
- **PostgreSQL** or **BigQuery** for data storage
- **Redis** for caching and real-time features
- **Celery** for background tasks (reports, notifications)

## 🧪 Development Workflow

### Adding New Features
1. Define types in `src/types/`
2. Create mock data in `src/data/mockData.ts`
3. Build components in `src/components/`
4. Create pages in `src/pages/`
5. Add routes in `src/App.tsx`
6. Update navigation in `src/components/layout/AppSidebar.tsx`

### Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the established design system
- Create reusable components
- Add mock data for realistic development
- Comment complex logic
- Use semantic HTML elements
